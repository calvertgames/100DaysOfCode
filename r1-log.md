#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jonathan Calvert

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 13, 2021.

#Log

#R1D1
Not a ton of coding. More of environment setup ...

1) Completed GitHub Hello World:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
https://github.com/calvertgames/hello-world

2) Setup Eclipse 4.18.0.20201210-1200

Created a Hello World example and configurd Ecliipse to use GitHub (not intuitive):
-Version Control (Team) --> Git --> Configuration
-Add Entry email : value
-Add Entry name : value

3) Found some useful links to help with GitHub configuration:
https://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/reproducible_research/post/rr-eclipse-git/
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html#github_push

4) Deleted forked 100DaysOfCode repo and created a new one, to allow for my own orginization/layout:

#R1D2
1) Archived original 100DayOfCode as 100DaysOfCodeR1D1 and cleaned up local git rep.
Ran into issues yesterday; Eclipse project wasn't properly connected to github.
Changes went to master brranch and the history was so different, I couldn't do a PR:  "There isnâ€™t anything to compare... entirely different commit histories."
Helpful link ... at least I think it helped me figured out that I had f'ed up:
https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-13/student-help/issues/76

2) Explored command line Git
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line

3) Made a new eclipse project, R1D2 and after a frustrating experience, "Source folder is not a java project." I associated a new project with the
GitHub 100DaysOfCoding.  Created a simple HelloWorld class, commited and pushed.  And then created HelloWorldAgain - Lord help me remember how to
create R1D3 tomorrow!

4) Thoughts heading into lunch.  I'm super rusty #ouch, but this comment is being made in eclipse and pushed back
to GitHub main ... so there is some hope.  I know the original intent of the challenge is to code for 1 hr a day ...
while I have sepent several hrs the last couple of days getting my local setup, re-learning the basics of eclipse and
making sure I can connect with https://github.com/calvertgames/100DaysOfCode - it's a start!
